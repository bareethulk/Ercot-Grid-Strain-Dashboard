# Ercot-Grid-Strain-Dashboard
The ERCOT Grid Strain Dashboard is an interactive analytics tool built in Streamlit to explore grid stress conditions in the ERCOT system during June 2025. The dashboard integrates multiple datasets — hourly demand, generation by fuel type, temperature, and CO₂ emissions, into a unified platform for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
