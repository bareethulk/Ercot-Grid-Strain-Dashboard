# ERCOT Grid Strain Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes ERCOT June 2025 grid strain conditions using system demand, generation mix, temperature, and CO₂ emissions data.  
An interactive Streamlit dashboard was developed to explore grid stress, fuel dependence, and emissions intensity during periods of high demand.

## Features
- Dynamic filtering by **date** and **hour range**.
- Key Metrics: Peak demand, max temperature, grid strain hours, avg CO₂ intensity.
- Visualizations:
  - Demand: hourly patterns, histograms, time trends.
  - Temperature vs Demand: scatter, hourly overlays, regression lines, temperature bins.
  - Generation: hourly fuel mix, strain vs normal fuel share.
  - Emissions: time trends, correlation heatmap.

## Dataset
- ERCOT system demand and generation data (June 2025).
- NOAA temperature data.
- EPA CAMPD emissions (2024 proxy for CO₂).

⚠️ Note: Due to size limits, the GitHub repo includes a **subset CSV** (`grid_strain_enriched.csv`) for demo purposes. Full dataset can be reproduced using the cleaning notebook.
