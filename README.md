# ERCOT Grid Strain Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes ERCOT June 2025 grid strain conditions using system demand, generation mix, temperature, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions data.  
An interactive Streamlit dashboard was developed to explore grid stress, fuel dependence, and emissions intensity during periods of high demand.

## Features
- Dynamic filtering by **date** and **hour range**.
- Key Metrics: Peak demand, max temperature, grid strain hours, avg CO‚ÇÇ intensity.
- Visualizations:
  - Demand: hourly patterns, histograms, time trends.
  - Temperature vs Demand: scatter, hourly overlays, regression lines, temperature bins.
  - Generation: hourly fuel mix, strain vs normal fuel share.
  - Emissions: time trends, correlation heatmap.

## Dataset
- ERCOT system demand and generation data (June 2025).
- NOAA temperature data.
- EPA CAMPD emissions (2024 proxy for CO‚ÇÇ).

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Due to size limits, the GitHub repo includes a **subset CSV** (`grid_strain_enriched.csv`) for demo purposes. Full dataset can be reproduced using the cleaning notebook.
